## TODO write documentation so we dont need to use lobotomy version

This branch contains the code version in which the dancebot begins to dance (hop) on power on instead of waiting for a webserver connection

While this is admittedly throwing away work, it is a more accessible/intuitive way to demo Dancebot for other RAS people
